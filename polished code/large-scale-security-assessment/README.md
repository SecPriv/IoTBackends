The following folder contains all the scripts for the security assessment of backends and for the results evaluation.

1. `mqtt/` contains the scripts for evaluating MQTT backends. 
   1. `mqtt_security_assessment.py` takes as input the start and end of the batch of Shodan MQTT backends (passed as a JSON file) to analyze and then tries to connect and record all topics for 40 seconds. Further, it tests via cotopaxi for known DoS vulnerabilities. The script is completed by `mqtt_connect.py` which is automatically executed. A folder for each backend is created containing a json file and the pcap file of the exchanged traffic.
   2. `parse_results.py` iterates over all the backends' directories and parses the results looking for information leaks and DoS vulnerabilities. It outputs a json file with all parsed results. For a more compact version of the results (e.g., only showing how many topics on average are collected, how many backends are affected by DoS vulnerabilities) run `summarize_results.py` on the output of the previous script.
   3. `add_country_provider_to_parsed_results.py` is necessary to add the country and provider to the output of `parse_results.py`. The output file is then used to run `connected_clients_boxplot.py` plotting how many connected clients per backend can be found either grouped by geographical region or provider (see Appendix D in the paper).
   4. `get_vulnerable_mqtt.py` returns a file with only the vulnerable MQTT backends. It organizes the vulnerabilities by vulnerability classe, either **information_leakage** or **DoS**. Takes as input the resulting file of script (3).
   5. `software_versions_analysis.py` analyses the versions collected for MQTT backends and check which ones have a version lower than a specified one (meaning they are potentially vulnerable CVEs affecting older software versions).
   6. Finally, `topic-classification` runs a zero-shot classification model to cluster MQTT topics. First, `get_regular_or_sys_topics.py` distinguishes SYS or regular topics as we are only interested in categorizing the latter. `nlp_classification.py` performs the actual classification. `topic_distribution.py` prints the distribution and `plot_topic_distribution.py` plots the distribution into a histogram.
